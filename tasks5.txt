Summary of Findings – DNS, TCP, and HTTP Traffic
1. DNS (Domain Name System)

Total Packets: 370
Message Types:

    Queries: 185 (50%)

    Responses: 185 (50%)
    Query Types:

    AAAA (IPv6): 134 (36.22%)

    HTTPS service: 121 (32.70%)

    A (IPv4): 115 (31.08%)
    Observations:

    All DNS responses returned “No Error”.

    Mix of IPv4 and IPv6 lookups indicates dual-stack browsing.

    Some queries for deeper subdomains (CDNs, tracking).

2. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

Notable Connections:

    Multiple TCP segments exchanged between 2401:4900:7c8e:… (your host) and 2a03:2880:f288:… (likely Facebook/Meta IPv6 address) over port 443 (HTTPS).

    Large payload sizes (1243 bytes per segment in many cases).

    Includes PSH, ACK, and retransmissions, suggesting active data transfer.
    Observations:

    TLSv1.2 sessions over TCP 443 indicate encrypted HTTPS traffic.

    At least one TCP retransmission was observed, possibly due to packet loss or network delay.

3. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)

From the TCP streams, some traffic likely carried HTTP before encryption (e.g., HTTP over TLS). In this capture:

    No plain HTTP (tcp.port == 80) traffic visible — all web traffic was encrypted.

    Any HTTP-like requests were encapsulated in TLS, meaning Wireshark showed them as Application Data and could not parse content without the server’s keys.
